# MangaFever.github.io
A webpage for the scanlation group mangafever

## pls checkout the issues tab

currently trying to authenticate to the webpage :p, i have access from the 
command line, but the website allows for better setup of gh-pages

my phone is currently unavailable for reasons. i'll have access tommorow, 
and will be able to do alot more

gh-pages will allow me to host for free

idk what the url will be, but it wont be something pretty like MangaFever.com
for that u would have to pay money

lemme explain:

dumbed down version of websites

u type in `example.com`
    ||
    \/
browser asks a DNS server what the ip address is for `example.com`
||
    \/
browser connencts to server at the ip address it got from the DNS server
    ||
    \/
server sends files to browser
    ||
    \/
browser uses those files to display stuff and react to user input

IP address (dumbed down): 
address that can be used to connect, think of it as an address for mail, 
u need a return and destination address, ur ISP 
(internet service provider, the one that lets ur home desktop connect to the internet)
usually provides a return address.

DNS: (dumbed down)
domain name system
a system that provides a mapping of domain names (like `example.com`) to IP addresses
u have to pay money to register a domain name
